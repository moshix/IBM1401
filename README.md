# IBM 1401 EMULATOR IN BAL 360 ASSEMBLY

This is an emulator for the venerable IBM 1401 mainframe computer of the early 60s. 

It is written in S/360 assembler and assembles (almost) cleanly with the IFOX assembler of MVS 3.8 put 8505 as delivered by the TK4 turnkey system 

Instructions on how to run the emulator are in the code itself, but I shall write up a manual, and also make a youtube video available on how to get it to run. 

enjoy!
